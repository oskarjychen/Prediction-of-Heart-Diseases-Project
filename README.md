This is a project that I finished on my own for a data science class at UBC. Below is a part of the abstract:

This is a study based on the findings presented in the database Heart Disease, which was donated in 1988. The database can be found on UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository. It includes "76 attributes, but all published experiments refer to using a subset of 14 of them" (Detrano et al., 1988). As the name implies, it is made up of 14 attributes that include a series of metrics related to a patient's health, and a field that indicates the presence of heart disease.

We are looking to answer a classification problem: whether the presence of heart diseases can be predicted through observing resting blood pressure and serum cholesterol. High blood pressure is "associated with the strongest evidence for causation [for cardiovascular disease]... and has a high prevalence of exposure (Fuchs and Whelton, 2020, p. 285). Fuchs and Whelton (2020) have also hypothesized that it is the "predominant risk factor" for heart diseases (p. 285), and that its prevalence has contributed to rising cardiovascular disease numbers. Serum cholesterol, on the other hand, has also long been established to be associated with heart diseases (Harvard, 2020). It would be interesting to apply the methods that we have been taught in DSCI 100 to see if these correlations show up sufficiently in a classification model that we will train.
